# Machine_Learning_course

As, I told you, this my course from udacity. But I modified it to use python 3 instead of python 2.
The below link contains the algorithms but without implementing algorithms, and uses python 2.

You only have to do this once, go into the tools/ directory, and run startup.py. 
It will first check for the python modules, then download and unzip a large dataset that we will use heavily later. 
The download/unzipping can take a while, but you donâ€™t have to wait for it to finish in order to get started on Part 1.
